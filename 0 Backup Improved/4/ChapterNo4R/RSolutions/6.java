/* 

6.- Assuming that a and b are variables of type int, fill in the following table:

a	b 		pow(a,b)	max(a,b)	a/b 	a%b		floorMod(a,b)
2	3		8.0			3			0		2		2
3	2		9.0			3			1		1		1
2	-3		0.125		2			0		2		-1
3	-2		0.11		3			-1		1		-1
-3	2		9.0			2			-1		-1		1
-3	-2		0.11		-2			1		-1		-1

Pow will get the power of a^b. When b is negative it will get roots. When a is negative and b is odd the power of a^b will be negative.
Max will get the bigger or more positive number
a/b is an integer division since both numbers are integers
a%b is modulus meaning it will get the reminder from the integer division
