4.- What is the difference between the following two statements?

	final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
	public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;

A. The first one is for a constant that can be used only for the methods inside the class and therefore every instance has its own copy, the second one is for a constant that can be used for every class since its public and is static so that it does not belong to any particular instance.
