5.- What is wrong with the following statement sequence?
	
	double diameter = 4.0;
	double circumference = 3.14 * diameter;

A. There is nothing wrong with the first statement, in the second one we should replace 3.14 magic number for some descriptive constant, and also take note that 3.14 is usually fewer Pi digits that the ones needed for any usefull calculation.
