/* 

14.- What is problematic about the following statement sequence?
	
	System.out.print("Please enter the number of cans");
	int cans = in.nextInt();

A. In the first statement prompting for a value there is no space and colon at the end of the string. The program will run however the prompt and the input value will be wrongly formatted.
