3.- Which of the following initializations are incorrect, and why?

	int dollars = 100.0;
	double balance = 100;

A. The first one has a number with a decimal point where it should have an integer number without one:

	int dollars = 100;
	or
	double dollars = 100.0;
	
The second is correct even if we are inserting an integer value into a double because int can always be converted into a double on the fly.
