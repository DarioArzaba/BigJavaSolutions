/*Write an application to pre-sell a limited number of cinema tickets. Each buyer can
buy as many as 4 tickets. No more than 100 tickets can be sold. Implement a proÂ­gram
called TicketSeller that prompts the user for the desired number of tickets and
then displays the number of remaining tickets. Repeat until all tickets have been
sold, and then display the total number of buyers.*/
