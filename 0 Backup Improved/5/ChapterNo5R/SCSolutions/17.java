17.- Suppose the user enters -1 into the earthquake program. What is printed?

A.

	The Richter scale does not contain negative values, so the user input must be incorrect. However the earthquake program allows for negative numbers since they fall below 4.5. This would mean a run time error since the input exceedes the expected range of inputs but does not generate an error and instead outputs the wrong answer (No destruction of buildings).
