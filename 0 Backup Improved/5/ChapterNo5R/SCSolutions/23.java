23.- Some people object to higher tax rates for higher incomes, claiming that you might end up with less money after taxes when you get a raise for working hard. What is the flaw in this argument?

A.

	This only applies to the people inside the higher bracket income. For most people higher income tax is in practice negligible, meaning that even when applied you will keep most of your money. Until the money you earn overall gets so high you should not be worried about money higher income tax should not be a problem.
