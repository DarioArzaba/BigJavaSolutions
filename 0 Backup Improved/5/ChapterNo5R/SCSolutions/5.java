5.- The variables fuelAmount and fuelCapacity hold the actual amount of fuel and the size of the fuel tank of a vehicle. If less than 10 percent is remaining in the tank, a status light should show a red color; otherwise it shows a green color. Simulate this process by printing out either "red" or "green".

A.

	if (fuelAmount < (0.10 * fuelCapacity)) {
		System.out.println("red");
	} else {
		System.out.println("green");
	}
