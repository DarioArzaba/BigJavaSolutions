4.- Consider the following statements to compute a discounted price:
	
	discountedPrice = originalPrice;
	if (originalPrice > 100) {
		discountedPrice = originalPrice - 10;
	}
	
What is the discounted price if the original price is 95? 100? 105?

A.
	If the original is 95 then it is lower than 100 and therefore it stays the same.
	If the original is 100 then it is lower than 100 and therefore it stays the same.
	If the original is 105 then it is bigger than 100 and therefore it will be minus 10, meaning 95.
