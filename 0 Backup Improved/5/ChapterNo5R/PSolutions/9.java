/* 

9.- Roman numbers. Write a program that converts a positive integer into the Roman number system. The Roman number system has digits:

	I 1
	V 5
	X 10
	L 50
	C 100
	D 500
	M 1,000

Numbers are formed according to the following rules:
	
	a. Only numbers up to 3,999 are represented.
	b. As in the decimal system, the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones are expressed separately.
	c. The numbers 1 to 9 are expressed as
		I 1 IV 4 VII 7 II 2 V 5 VIII 8 III 3 VI 6 IX 9
		As you can see, an I preceding a V or X is subtracted from the value,
		you can never have more than three Iâ€™s in a row.
	d. Tens and hundreds are done the same way, except that the letters X, L, C and C, D, M are used instead of I, V, X, respectively.
	
Your program should take an input, such as 1978, and convert it to Roman numerals,
