/* 

14.- When two points in time are compared, each given as hours (in military time, ranging from 0 and 23) and minutes, the following pseudocode determines which comes first.
	
	If hour1 < hour2
		time1 comes first.
	Else if hour1 and hour2 are the same
		If minute1 < minute2
			time1 comes first.
		Else if minute1 and minute2 are the same
			time1 and time2 are the same.
		Else
			time2 comes first.
	Else
		time2 comes first.
	
Write a program that prompts the user for two points in time and prints the time that comes first, then the other time. In your program, supply a class Time and a method public int compareTo(Time other) that returns â€“1 if the time comes before the other, 0 if both are the same, and 1 otherwise.
