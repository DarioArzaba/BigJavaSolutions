2.- Which parts of a computer can store program code? Which can store user data?

A. The distinction between program code and user data is not so clear, both can be stored on the primary and secondary memory of the computer. Generally speaking user data (documents, photos, videos, source code) is stored in the Hard Drive (secondary - permanent) while program code (being executed) is stored in the RAM (primary - temporary).
