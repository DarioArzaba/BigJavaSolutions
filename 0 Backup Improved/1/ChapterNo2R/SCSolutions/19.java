/* 

19.- When you used your computer, you may have experienced a program that “crashed” (quit spontaneously) or “hung” (failed to respond to your input). Is that behavior a compile-time error or a run-time error?

A. They are run-time errors. The program was succesfully compiled and will run up to a certain point.
