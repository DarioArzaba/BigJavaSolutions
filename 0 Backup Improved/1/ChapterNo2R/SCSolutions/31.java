31.- Look at the API documentation of the String class. Which method would you use to obtain the string "hello, world!" from the string "Hello, World!"?

A. Searching the documentation we find that (toLowerCase), the opposing method of (toUpperCase), does what its name suggests and transforms the alphabetic characters inside the String object to lower case. String class documentation can be found in:
