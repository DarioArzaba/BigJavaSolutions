/* 

29.- Is the toUpperCase method of the String class an accessor or a mutator?

A. Both types of methods can access, use and modify the information of the objects they are being applied to, however only the mutators actually save the changes in the object. In this case the method (toUpperCase) from the (String) class is an accessor since it doesn't save its changes into the original String.
