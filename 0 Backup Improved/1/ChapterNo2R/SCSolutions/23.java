23.- Consider the following pseudocode for finding the most attractive photo from a sequence of photos. Is this an algorithm that will find the most attractive photo?

	Pick the first photo and call it "the best so far".
	For each photo in the sequence
		If it is more attractive than the "best so far"
			Discard "the best so far".
			Call this photo "the best so far".
	The photo called "the best so far" is the most attractive photo in the sequence.

A. No, until we define exactly what we mean, when we try to compare two of the photos and select the more attractive one.
