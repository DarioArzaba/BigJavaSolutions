/* 

32.- In the API documentation of the String class, look at the description of the trim method. What is the result of applying trim to the string " Hello, Space ! "? (Note the spaces in the string.)

A. Searching the documentation we find that the method (trim) removes the leading and trailing spaces from the String object. Resulting in the String:

	"Hello, Space !"

String class documentation can be found in:
