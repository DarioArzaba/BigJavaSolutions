3.- What does a computer user need to know about programming in order to play a video game?

A. In principle, nothing. The videogame is a tipe of software that was previously programmed and the final user only interacts with the end result of such programming. But, like many other software, if the user wanted to adapt or modify the videogame then some programming knowledge would be required.
