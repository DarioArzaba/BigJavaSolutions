25.- Suppose you have a random sequence of black and white marbles and want to rearrange it so that the black and white marbles are grouped together. Consider this algorithm:

	Repeat until sorted
		Locate the first black marble that is preceded by a white marble, and switch them.
	
What does the algorithm do with the sequence W-B-W-B-B ? Spell out the steps until the algorithm stops.
