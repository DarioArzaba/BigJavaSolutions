26.- Suppose you have a random sequence of colored marbles. Consider this pseudocode:

	Repeat until sorted
		Locate the first marble that is preceded by a marble of a different color, and switch them.

Why is this not an algorithm?

A. It doesn't have the Finiteness property. All algorithms must stop after a finite number of instructions. Here we don't have a clear way of telling the program when it should stop switching the marbles.
