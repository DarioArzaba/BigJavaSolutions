3.- What is the public interface of a class? How does it differ from the implementation of a class?

A. The public interface is the part of a class that it's visible to the programmer, this part sets the tools needed to create and modify new objects that belong to the class. The hidden implementation of the class are the detailed instructions needed for the tools to execute their tasks. The programmer only needs to know the public interface in order to use these tools.
