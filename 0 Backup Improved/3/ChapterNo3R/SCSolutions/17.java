/* 

17.- Consider a Car class that simulates fuel consumption in a car. We will assume a fixed efficiency (in miles per gallon) that is supplied in the constructor. There are methods for adding gas, driving a given distance, and checking the amount of gas left in the tank. Make a card for a Car object, choosing suitable instance variables and showing their values after the object was constructed.

A. This is called tracing an object, in this case it would be:

	Car myCar //Trace of myCar object
	Car(mpg) //Construct myCar object with efficiency in mpg
	addGas(amount) //Add a certain amount of gas in gallons.
	drive(distance) //Drive for a certain distance in miles.
	getGasLeft() //Returns the gas left in the tank in gallons.

	The object starts with two instance variables:
		gasLeft = 0;
		milesPerGallon = 25;
