/* 

18.- Trace the following method calls for the Car Efficiency class:

	Car myCar = new Car(25);
	myCar.addGas(20);
	myCar.drive(100);
	myCar.drive(200);
	myCar.addGas(5);

A. This would affect the instance variables in the fallowing way after each statement:

	milesPerGallon = 25; gasLeft = 0;
	gasLeft = 20;
	gasLeft = 16;
	gasLeft = 8;
	gasLeft = 13;
