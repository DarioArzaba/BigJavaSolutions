16.- In How To 1.1, you made assumptions about the price of gas and annual usage to compare cars. Ideally, you would like to know which car is the better deal without making these assumptions. Why canâ€™t a computer program solve that problem?

A. Because, following the algorithm principles, a computer program needs unambiguous data in order to get the only *correct* answer. IRL computer programs can use approximate data as input, in order to generate useful approximate results. We may also be able to find sources of information with more concrete data.
