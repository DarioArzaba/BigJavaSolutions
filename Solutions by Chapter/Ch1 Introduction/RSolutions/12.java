12.- The cafeteria offers a discount card for sale that entitles you, during a certain period, to a free meal whenever you have bought a given number of meals at the regular price. The exact details of the offer change from time to time. Describe an algorithm that lets you determine whether a particular offer is a good buy. What other inputs do you need?

A. Suppose we frequently buy our meals in this cafeteria, we should be able to estimate the approximate time interval between each meal we buy there. This is the last input we need in our algorithm (Assuming that we can afford the regular price of every meal).

	Get the approximate time interval between each meal we buy in the cafeteria.
	Get the number of meals necesary to get the free meal.
	Get the interval of time the offer will be valid.
	Define the time interval needed as the interval of time the offer will be valid divided by the number of meals necesary to get the free meal.
	If the time interval between each meal we buy is less than the time interval needed
	 	Then the offer is a good buy.
