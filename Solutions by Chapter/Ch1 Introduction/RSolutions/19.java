/* 

19.- The ancient Babylonians had an algorithm for determining the square root of a number (a). Start with an initial guess of (a / 2). Then find the average of your guess (g) and (a/g). Thatâ€™s your next guess. Repeat until two consecutive guesses are close enough. Write the pseudocode for this algorithm.

A.  

	Start by getting (a)
	Define (g1) as (a/2)
	Define (g2) as ((g1+(a/g1))/2)
	Repeat until g1 and g2 are close enough:
		Save the last value of g2 in g1
		Redefine g2 as ((g1+(a/g1))/2);
	End by returning (g2)
