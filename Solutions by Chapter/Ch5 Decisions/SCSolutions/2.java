2.- Consider the following if statement to compute a discounted price:
	
	if (originalPrice > 100) {
		discountedPrice = originalPrice - 20;
	} else {
		discountedPrice = originalPrice - 10;
	}

What is the discounted price if the original price is 95? 100? 105?

A.
	If original is (95) then it is lower then 100, therefore the discounted is 10 less, meaning 85.
	If the original is (100) it is not equal to 100, therefore the discounted is 10 less, meaning 90.
	If the original is (105) it is bigger than 100, therefore the discounted is 20 less, meaning 85.
