8. What is the error in this statement?
	
	if (scoreA = scoreB) {
		System.out.println("Tie");
	}

A. In the condition there is a single (=) sign, thereforescoreA and scoreB are not being compared, the value of scoreB is just being asigned to scoreA. To compare them we need to use a double (==) equal sign.
