2.- Explain the difference between
	
	s = 0;
	if (x > 0) { s++; }
	if (y > 0) { s++; }
	
	and
	
	s = 0;
	if (x > 0) { s++; }
	else if (y > 0) { s++; }

A. The first one will add 1 to the variable (s) if (x) is bigger than 0. It will add another 1 if the variable (y) also happens to be bigger than 0.
 
 The second one will add 1 to the variable (s) only if (x) is bigger than 0. If (x) is lower than or equal to 0 and (y) is bigger than 0 only then will it add 1.
