21.- Suppose an ancient civilization had constructed circular pyramids. Write a program that determines the surface area from measurements that you can determine from the ground.

A. To calculate the surface area of a circular pyramid or cone we only need the radius and the height.
Since we can only take measurements from ground we find the height using the law of sines and the angle it makes to the top.
Once we have the heigth we use the fallowing formula:

	A = Pi*r*(r+Root(h^2+r^2))
