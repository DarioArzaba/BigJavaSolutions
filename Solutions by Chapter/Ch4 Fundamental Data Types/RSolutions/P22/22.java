22.- A cocktail shaker is composed of three cone sections. Using realistic values for the radii and heights, compute the total volume, using the formula given in Self Check 21 for a cone section. Then develop an algorithm that works for arbitrary dimensions.

	A1 = (Pi*r1*(r1+Math.sqrt(h*h+r*r)));
	A2 = (Pi*r2*(r2+Math.sqrt(h*h+r*r)));
	A3 = (Pi*r3*(r3+Math.sqrt(h*h+r*r)));
	A = A1 + A2 + A3;
