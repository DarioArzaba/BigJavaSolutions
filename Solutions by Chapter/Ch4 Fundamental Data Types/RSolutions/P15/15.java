/* 

15.- Explain what each of the following program segments computes.
	
	a.
	x = 2;
	y = x + x;
	b.
	s = "2";
	t = s + s;

A.
The first asigns the value (2) to the variable (x) then assigns the sum of two (x) into (y). Since the value of (x) is (2) we can substitute their values in the sum as (2+2) therefore storing the result of (4) into the (y) variable.
The second one asigns the string ("2") into the variable (s) then it assigns the concatonation of two copies of the string into (t). Since the value of (s) is ("2") we can substitute their values in the sum as ("2" + "2") therefore storing the result of ("22") into the (t) variable.
