/* 

18.- Write pseudocode for a program that computes the first and last digit of a number. For example, if the input is 23456, the program should print 2 and 6.

	Hint: Use % and Math.log10

	Use modulus and powers of 10 to advance to the digit that we want.
	Then print the last digit by truncating the numbers.
	Since we have the digit as 5 decimal places we can do the modulus calculaton 1 and then 5 times.
