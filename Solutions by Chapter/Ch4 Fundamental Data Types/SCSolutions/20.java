20.- For a particular car, repair and maintenance costs in year 1 are estimated at $100; in year 10, at $1,500. Assuming that the repair cost increases by the same amount every year, develop pseudocode to compute the repair cost in year 3 and then generalize to year n.

A.
	Cost increased 1400 in 9 years therefore it is increasing 156 per year.
	The repear in year 3 will be = 100 + (2 * 156)
	The repear in year n = 100 + ( (n-1) * 156)
