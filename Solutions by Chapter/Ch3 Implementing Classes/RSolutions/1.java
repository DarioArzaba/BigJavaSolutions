/* 

1.- What is the public interface of the Counter class in Section 3.1? How does it differ from the implementation of the class?

A. The public interface gives us the methods (reset, click, getValue) that the programmer can use (by calling them on other classes). The implementation is the inner-workings of those methods, that in this case, result in changing the current value of the Counter Value Field.
