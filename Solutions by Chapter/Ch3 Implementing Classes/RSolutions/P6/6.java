6.- Suppose the implementor of the Time class of Exercise R3.5 changes from one implementation strategy to another, keeping the public interface unchanged. What do the programmers who use the Time class need to do?

A. Nothing. Supposedly if other classes use the Time class, they are only using it's public interface (the one that went unchanged).
