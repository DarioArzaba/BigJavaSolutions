/* 

10.- After closing time, the store manager would like to know how much business was transacted during the day. Modify the CashRegister class to enable this functionality. Supply methods getSalesTotal and getSalesCount to get the total amount of all sales and the number of sales. Supply a method reset that resets any counters and totals so that the next dayâ€™s sales start from zero.
