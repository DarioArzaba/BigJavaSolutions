/* 

25.- In the deposit method, what is the meaning of this.amount? Or, if the expression
has no meaning, why not?

	public void deposit(double amount) {
		balance = balance + this.amount;
	}

A. It is not a legal expression since the class does not specify an instance variable named amount, the only variable with this identifier is the parameter variable of the method.
