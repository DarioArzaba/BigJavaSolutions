21.- What do local variables and parameter variables have in common? In which essential aspect do they differ?

A. Variables of both categories are related to the methods of a class. Both are created and used each time a method is called, and both cease to exist when the method exits. Parameter variables are initialized automatically with the values supplied as arguments from where the method was originally called. Local variables are inside methods and need to be initialized explicitly.
