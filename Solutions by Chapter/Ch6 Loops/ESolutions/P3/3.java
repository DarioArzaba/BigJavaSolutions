3.- Write programs that read a sequence of integer inputs and print:

    a. The smallest and largest of the inputs.
    b. The number of even and odd inputs.
    c. Cumulative totals. For example, if the input is 1 7 2 9, the program should print 1 8 10 19.
    d. All adjacent duplicates. For example, if the input is 1 3 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 2, the program should print 3 5 6.
