/* 

•• E6.6 Write a program that reads a set of floating­point values. Ask the user to enter the
values (prompting only a single time for the values), then print
• the average of the values.
• the smallest of the values.
• the largest of the values.
• the range, that is the difference between the smallest and largest.
Your program should use a class DataSet. That class should have a method
public void add(double value)
and methods getAverage, getSmallest, getLargest, and getRange.
