•• Business E6.21 Write a program that first asks the user to type
in today’s price of one dollar in Japanese yen,
then reads U.S. dollar values and converts each
to Japanese yen. Use 0 as the sentinel value to denote the end of dollar inputs. Then
the program reads a sequence of yen amounts and converts them to dollars. The
second sequence is terminated by another zero value.
