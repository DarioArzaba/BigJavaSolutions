36.- Explain in detail how to use your debugger to inspect the balance stored in a Bankâ€“Account object.

A. Activate the debugger. Put a breakthrow where the Bank-Account object is defined.
Inspect the object properties inside the inspector panel. This panel also lists the values of every variable in the scope.
Also when the debugger is activated you can hover the object to look at the values of the variables inside the instance.
