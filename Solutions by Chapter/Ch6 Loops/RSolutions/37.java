37.- Explain the divide­and­conquer strategy to get close to a bug in a debugger

A. When using the debugger locate keep an eye on the problematic value, divide your code using breakpoints in half (if it is a big proyect). Eventually you will locate the method where the value is being changed. You can do the same inside the method, isolating the variable to a single method further reduces the necessary steps.
