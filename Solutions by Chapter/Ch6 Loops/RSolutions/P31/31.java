31.- Suppose you design an educational game to teach children how to read a clock. How do you generate random values for the hours and minutes?

A. Using the Random library to generate the random seed and then using the modulus operator to cicle the the hours. This could be done with a loop to generate new hours and minutes. If we wanted to generate the hours and minutes in order it would require a nested loop, with an outer loop for the hours and an inner loop for the minutes.
