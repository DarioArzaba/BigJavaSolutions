12.- Explain the difference between an object and an object variable.

A. An object is an actual entity created with a class, uppon creation it's various contents are hidden and scattered in memory. An object variable stores a reference (object reference) to the (combined) location in memory (addresses) where all the contents of the object are stored, and it's our main way to access those contents. Modifying an object variable does not modify the object, it only modifies the object reference. We say that an object has multiple object variables when they all reference it's location in memory.
