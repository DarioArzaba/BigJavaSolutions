/* 

8.- The (GregorianCalendar) class describes a time object based on the Gregorian calendar. 

	GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar(); // Todayâ€™s date
	GregorianCalendar eckertsBirthday = new GregorianCalendar(1919, Calendar.APRIL, 9);
	
The (add) method is used to add a number of days. The (get) method allows to get diferent fields.

	cal.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 10); // Now cal is ten days from today
	int dayOfMonth = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
	int month = cal.get(Calendar.MONTH);
	int year = cal.get(Calendar.YEAR);
	int weekday = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK);
	
Write a program that prints the date and weekday 100 days from today. The weekday of your birthday. The date 10000 days from your birthday.
