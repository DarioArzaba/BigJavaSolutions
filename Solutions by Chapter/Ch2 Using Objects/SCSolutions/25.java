/* 

25.- Write a statement to save the object that you constructed in the previous question, inside a variable.

A. To save a newly created object from the PrintStream class, we need to use a variable with the PrintStream class as its data type followed by its variable identifier.

	// Data Type varName = createObjKeyword classConstructor(ConstructorArguments);
	// Therefore:
	
	PrintStream out = new PrintStream("output.txt");
