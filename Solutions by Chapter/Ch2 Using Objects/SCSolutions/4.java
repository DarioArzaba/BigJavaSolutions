/* 

4.- What is wrong with the following variable declaration? 

	int miles per gallon = 39.4

A. You can't have spaces in a variable name, use underscores or camelcase instead. The data type (int) can't hold numeric values that have a decimal component, use (double) instead. There is a missing semicolon at the end of the statement.

	double milesPerGallon = 39.4;
