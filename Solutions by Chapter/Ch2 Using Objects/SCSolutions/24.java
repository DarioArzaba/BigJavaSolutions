24.- The PrintStream class has a constructor whose argument is the name of a file. How do you construct a PrintStream object with the construction argument "output.txt"?

A. To call the constructor of a class and create a new object we use the keyword (new) followed by the class name (PrintStream) as a method, meaning that we add parenthesis. Different constructors will require different arguments as inputs, that's how we differentiate them.

	new PrintStream("output.txt");
	
This constructor, with the name of a file as its argument, is defined in the PrintStream class documentation:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html#PrintStream-java.lang.String-
