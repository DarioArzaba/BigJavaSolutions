17.- What are the arguments in the method call river.replace("p", "s")?

A. Arguments are a comma separated list of values that a method needs to function as intended. The list goes inside the parenthesis that accompany all methods. Some methods do not need any arguments, in that case the parenthesis remains empty. In this case the method (replace), being applied to the object (river), and as defined by the (String) class, is using two arguments. The arguments are the strings "p" and "s".
